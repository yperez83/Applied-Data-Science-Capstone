## Executive Summary
Using trustworthy launch data and various computer models, the optimum parameters of launching a successful competing rocket launching company were determined.

## Introduction
The primary goal of this research is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of successfully landing the Falcon 9 first stage of a rocket launch. SpaceX significantly reduce launch costs by reusing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. By reliably predicting the success of this critical phase, the research aims to estimate the overall cost of a launch, a key factor that is crucial for a competitor in the rocket launch market. Real world launch data are leveraged to build our predictive model.

## Methodology
Collect - Collect raw launch data from high-ranking websites
Preprocess - Clean data by handling missing values and filtering
EDA Perform  - exploratory data analysis and SQL
Visualization  - Create interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
AI Models - Perform predictive analysis using AI suite in Python
